In a recent guest post on [Intoli](https://intoli.com)'s blog, I described
the basics of using [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) to build data
science pipelines.

I also introduced the `JupyterNotebookTask` class that I wrote to run Jupyter
notebooks as Luigi tasks.

Check out [this](https://intoli.com/blog/luigi-jupyter-notebooks/) and
