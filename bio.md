# Origin
Born in [Torino](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Turin,+Metropolitan+City+of+Turin,+Italy/@45.0702388,7.6000488,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47886d126418be25:0x8903f803d69c77bf!8m2!3d45.070312!4d7.6868565) (Italy) to Dada and Maurizio Ciollaro, Mattia is the youngest of their 1 children.

His birth date, Sep. 20th 1988, suggests that Dada and Maurizio started producing the hardware somewhere around the end-of-the-year holidays of 1987.
It is believed that [a particularly favorable Billboard hot 100 singles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_1987) and a strong interest in Tequila greatly facilitated the assembly of the main components.

# Alpha version
Towards 2007, the OS is installed and booting completes. Mattia begins his studies in Statistics.

First sources are successfully compiled: Mattia obtains a Bachelor's degree (2010) in Statistics at the University of Torino.

# Beta version
Logs look good and no system crashes are registered up to this point. Mattia is thus admitted to the [Allievi Program](http://www.carloalberto.org/education/allievi/)
of the [Collegio Carlo Alberto](http://www.carloalberto.org).

From the Collegio, he receives an Allievo Diploma (2010) and a Master in Statistics and Applied Mathematics (2012).
In 2012, he also receives a Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Torino.

# Hic sunt leones
Mattia graduates from the Collegio and decides to venture into uncharted territories on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.
His new quest begins at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) (Pittsburgh, PA).

# Programming languages
In 2015, Beckie and Mattia meet.
It's love.
Coding standards are revised and the English becomes the primary programming language for the project.

# First official release
During his stay in Pittsburgh, Mattia collects enough evidence to conclude that:

1. getting rid of his Italian accent is a lost cause

2. but that's OK, [English is not the spoken language in the area anyway](http://pittsburghspeech.pitt.edu/PittsburghSpeech_PgheseOverview.html)

3. the locals will not agree to adopt the metric system.

In 2016, Mattia is awarded a PhD in Statistics.

# How do you like them apples?
In the summer of 2016, Beckie and Mattia leave Pittsburgh and move to the Big Apple.
Still no signs of the metric system.

# Deployment into the production environment
Mattia joins the Analytics division of [New York Life Insurance](https://www.newyorklife.com), where he collaborates on a project to develop and implement a new generation of survival models.
At New York Life, Mattia also works with other teams to support the evaluation of new underwriting procedures.

Mattia's next gig is at [Spreemo Health](https://www.spreemohealth.com).
At Spreemo, his focus is on the estimation of error rates in diagnostic MRI exams and on the design of meaningful quality scores to distinguish accurate Radiology providers from less accurate ones.

# Major upgrades
Mattia issues a pull request to Beckie.
It appears that there are no conflicts, so Beckie approves it.
The merge is successful: Beckie and Mattia get married in November 2017.

# Current version
Mattia is under active development. [Get in touch](/contacts/) if you are want to download the bleeding edge.
